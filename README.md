Graffiti Dashboard
=====

##The Problem

Asheville City Council has a new initiative to handle graffiti in the city.  As new initiatives are developed to combat graffiti, the city wants to insure the initiatives are impactful.  For our part, we would like create a Graffiti Dashboard.  The dashboard should show anything that helps demonstrate how an initiative is impacting the city.

##Data 

* Graffiti data is available using the PublicStuff api at http://www.publicstuff.com/developers  
* Please use the key - 58j013k159vpqz87xd85df0uy7epvl
* There is a quick how to use the api document here: https://github.com/CodeForAsheville/CityAVL_311_API
* Also please feel to use any data on the city's open data portal that might help - http://opendatacatalog.ashevillenc.gov/
* Added more Graffiti data from another source.  You can find the additional data at: http://opendatacatalog.ashevillenc.gov/opendata/resource/84/city-of-asheville-mobile-311-graffiti-reports/

##Rules

Keep it simple. We are not looking for a finished product, but instead think "minimal"... something that could start us down the path of awesome.  

* You may use, borrow other code.  
* However, putting the app together should be done by you.
* You can ask us questions - We prefer you use this repo's issues as the communications to do it. (Email is also fine)



##Submitting the app

We really prefer to get submissions via GitHub and show the working app via GitHub pages.  But if you have other ways of working, that's fine. Just be sure the code is freely available on the web.

**Please complete your submission by Friday, June 6th, at 9am.** Early submissions are welcome!
